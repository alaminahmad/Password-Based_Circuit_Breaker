# Simulation of Password-Based Circuit Breaker using Proteus Software

This project uses a password-based system to enhance security and user-friendly access control for electrical circuits. It integrates hardware components like an Arduino Microcontroller, keypad, relay module, LED indicators, and a display module for efficient control.  
The primary aim of this project is to enhance safety, security, and operational control in the management of electrical circuits by developing a robust and user-friendly password-based circuit breaker system.

This project is driven by the following two main objectives  
• To interface Arduino microcontroller with Keypad, Liquid Crystal Display, Relay, and LED.

• To build an Arduino program to on an LED if the correct password is inputted to a keypad and to turn off a lamp is an incorrect password is inputted



This project successfully implements a secure and user-friendly system for controlling electrical circuits. The system elegantly guides users through the process, ensuring password validation and enabling efficient control. By prioritizing both security and ease of use, this project provides a practical solution for managing electrical circuits, enhancing overall functionality and user experience.

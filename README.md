### Simulation of Password-Based Circuit Breaker using Proteus Software

This project uses a password-based system to enhance security and user-friendly access control for electrical circuits. It integrates hardware components like an Arduino Microcontroller, keypad, relay module, LED indicators, and a display module for efficient control.  
The primary aim of this project is to enhance safety, security, and operational control in the management of electrical circuits by developing a robust and user-friendly password-based circuit breaker system.

This project is driven by the following two main objectives  
• To interface Arduino microcontroller with Keypad, Liquid Crystal Display, Relay, and LED.

• To build an Arduino program to on an LED if the correct password is inputted to a keypad and to turn off a lamp is an incorrect password is inputted

### **BLOCK DIAGRAM OF THE PROJECT**

The project’s block diagram shown below illustrates its architecture and key components. The Arduino microcontroller is the central controller, connecting to inputs like the power supply, switch, and keypad. The power supply provides energy, the switch controls, and the keypad allows secure password input. The LCD displays the system status, and the circuit breaker controls circuits. This diagram shows how user input interacts with the Arduino to manage electrical circuits effectively.

In the figure above we can see the relay is turned on and the lamp is ON.

However, when an incorrect password is used the relay will be deactivated and the lamp will be turned off as shown in the figure below.
